src/Data/Binary/Builder/Base.hs:67:1: Warning:
    The import of ‘Data.Monoid’ is redundant

    Deprecated: "If you think you know what you are doing, use 'unsafePerformIO'. If you are sure you know what you are doing, use 'unsafeDupablePerformIO'. If you enjoy sharing an address space with a malevolent agent of chaos, try 'accursedUnutterablePerformIO'."
